NOTES:
-----

* I should use a dynamically allocated structure for the computers' tasks (or not?)
* Both the frame index and the frame number are uint32 so no negative numbers are supported.
* Job logs are removed when the job is deleted by user request, if the job is deleted because of a failure
  they are not removed.
