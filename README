DrQueue - The Open Source Distributed Render Queue
--------------------------------------------------

DrQueue is the Open Source Distributed Render Queue. It is the Open
Source alternative to other comercial products. It has been tested on
renderfarms with more 200 processors and mixed architectures.

DrQueue has been coded and is maintained by Jorge Daza <jorge@drqueue.org>
though you can find a list of contributors on the CREDITS file.

DrQueue runs on Linux, Irix, FreeBSD and Mac OS X at the time of this
writing. Also has scripts generators for Maya, Blender, BMRT and Pixie.
But it can handle any other renderer or application that supports
command line.

DrQueue could be run in Windows with the help of UWin. Any feedback on
this topic will be welcome.

DrQueue if fully scriptable, through it's API one can code complex
distributed systems but out of the box is easily managed by advanced end
users.

You can find everything you might need in it's web site:
http://www.drqueue.org/

Also there is an anonymous svn repository where you can get the latest
development version. Please give feedback through the forums, email or
bug tracker, regarding any issue that might arise.

You can also find some of us at #drqueue in irc.freenode.net 

Happy Hacking.
